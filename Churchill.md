# Churchill
Churchill is so glamorous(in his unmatched eloquence, bravery, tactics and so much more) that often leaves me wonder how such can be achieved by a human being. 

## Hero of the Empire

This inspiring biography is the first book I read about Churchill. It changed lot of assumptions I had for Churchill and unwind many mysteries I long held. 

“Long after night had descended completely, obscuring everything before him but watch fires and the occasional dull gleam of a bayonet, Churchill, unable to sleep, peered intently at the stars overhead. As he listened to nearby soldiers tensely coughing and shifting in their trenches, yearning for the night to end, he contemplated “those impartial stars, which shine as calmly on Piccadilly Circus as on Inayat Kila.”

Comment: It’s interesting that Chines has a similar proverb “但愿人长久，千里共婵娟。” Such melancholy observations must be made at the especially sentimental moments. 

“I do not believe the Gods would create so potent a being as myself for so prosaic an ending.”

Churchill believed that, whatever had kept him alive on the battlefield, whether divine intervention of simply good fortune, his luck has been “set faire,” and he was eager to test its indulgence. “on what do these things depend,” he mused as a train carried him home. “Chance-Providence-God-the-Devil – call it what you will… Whatever it may be – I do not complain.”
