# Churchill
Churchill is so glamorous(in his unmatched eloquence, bravery, tactics and so much more) that often leaves me wonder how such can be achieved by a human being. 

## Hero of the Empire

This inspiring biography is the first book I read about Churchill. It changed lot of assumptions I had for Churchill and unwind many mysteries I long held. 

“Long after night had descended completely, obscuring everything before him but watch fires and the occasional dull gleam of a bayonet, Churchill, unable to sleep, peered intently at the stars overhead. As he listened to nearby soldiers tensely coughing and shifting in their trenches, yearning for the night to end, he contemplated “those impartial stars, which shine as calmly on Piccadilly Circus as on Inayat Kila.”

Comment: It’s interesting that Chines has a similar proverb “但愿人长久，千里共婵娟。” Such melancholy observations must be made at the especially sentimental moments.
