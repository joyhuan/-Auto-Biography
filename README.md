# Biography and Autobiography
The genres always attract me because they are like extracts of life. People struggle to leave some traces of their life. There's self-importance in such endeavor, so it is better justified.

Out of the tons of (auto)biographies, I'm particularly drawn to the ones about WWII. I have this strong attachment to WWII for three major reasons: 

1. Matters escape mundane in conflicts, especially conflicts involved top players on all sides. WWII, no doubt, is such a rare time. 
2. Wars normally have a hue of exotic charm.
3. The TV program I watched 90% of the time before I was seven was about war. 

Though this repo wonâ€™t fully devote to WWII, much contents will.
